Timetable is a schedule or event to take place at a particular time. 
Institutions/Schools/Colleges/Universities are the regular users of such timetables. 
They need to schedule their course to meet the need of current duration and facilities that are available to them.
Since timetables are being prepared manually which takes long time for the preparation and it also causes clashes between the classes.
so this system will help the organizations to prepare the timetable automatically.
Since the manual preparation of the timetable causes many problems,our system will help to prepare the timetable based on their 
requirements. 
The system will take certain inputs, depending upon these  it will generate a possible time table without any clashes between the 
classes which also makes optimal utilization of all resources in a way that will best suit any of constraints or college rules.
